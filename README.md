### Modeling and Decoupled Control of Series-Connected Split-Phase Synchronous Machines with Open-Circuit Fault
[Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8891722)

I started with developing a model for field-oriented control of a split-phase PMSM in Simulink. I verified the decoupled control by providing control voltages in the &alpha; - &beta; frame, which corresponded to torque-producing voltages. However, when the control voltages in the z<sub>1</sub>-z<sub>2</sub> plane were applied, the machine did not produce any torque. Further, I experimentally verified the speed control of two series-connected PMSMs driven by a single six-phase inverter, with coding in TI F28335S microcontroller. This research illustrated the potential applications of split-phase machines in electric vehicles and rovers.

### Control scheme using Reaction Control Thrusters for Pitch Stability during Atmospheric Abort of Crew Module
[Publication](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-3938-9_11)

We started by identifying the crew module's region of stability, by utilizing the wind tunnel data to identify the trim points. Then, a hysteresis controller was designed that utilized the flight path angle and angle of attack data to generate the required control action. A feasibility study was also conducted to determine the optimum RCS thruster force for achieving desired mission objectives within the specified time. A modified control logic was also designed that aimed at reducing the thruster chattering and enhancing the fuel efficiency.

### Modeling and Decoupled Control of Series-Connected Split-Phase Synchronous Machines with Open-Circuit Fault
[Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8891722)

I started with developing a model for field-oriented control of a split-phase PMSM in Simulink. I verified the decoupled control by providing control voltages in the &alpha; - &beta; frame, which corresponded to torque-producing voltages. However, when the control voltages in the z<sub>1</sub>-z<sub>2</sub> plane were applied, the machine did not produce any torque. Further, I experimentally verified the speed control of two series-connected PMSMs driven by a single six-phase inverter, with coding in TI F28335S microcontroller. This research illustrated the potential applications of split-phase machines in electric vehicles and rovers.

The video illustrates the decoupled control of the two motors, where one motor runs at a constant speed and the second motor undergoes a transient. It is seen that the speed reversal is smooth and does not affect the dynamics of the first motor.

### Control scheme using Reaction Control Thrusters for Pitch Stability during Atmospheric Abort of Crew Module
[Publication](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-3938-9_11)

We started by identifying the crew module's region of stability, by utilizing the wind tunnel data to identify the trim points. Then, a hysteresis controller (shown below) was designed that utilized the flight path angle and angle of attack data to generate the required control action. A feasibility study was also conducted to determine the optimum RCS thruster force for achieving desired mission objectives within the specified time. A modified control logic was also designed that aimed at reducing the thruster chattering and enhancing fuel efficiency.

### Simulation and Control of a Half-bridge Center-tapped Series Resonant Converter (SRC)

I developed an LTspice simulation model of the converter using the manufacturer‚Äôs component models. The converter operation under ZVS and non-ZVS conditions was verified and loss analysis was performed. To design the controller, first, a small signal model of the converter was developed, and its operation was compared against the switching model in Simulink. Then a voltage compensator was designed using frequency response analysis (shown below) in the continuous-time domain. The controller was discretized using Backward-Euler approximation and the performance of both continuous and its discrete-time equivalent was compared. The compensator was then implemented on a TI F28379D MCU. The closed loop system performance was verified by providing changes in reference, input voltage, and output load. The maximum output settling time observed was 10ms.

### Design, Simulation and Control of a Multi-Output Flyback DC/DC Converter

Conducted trade-off studies for the selection of MOSFETs/Diodes and reactive components to meet 92% converter efficiency. A model of the converter was simulated in PLECS. A small-signal model of the converter was derived and a lead-lag compensator using frequency response analysis was designed to meet the specifications. The closed loop system performance (shown below) was validated in PLECS, where I achieved a 10% maximum overshoot and 20ms settling time under various transient conditions.

### Torque and Speed Control of a Three-phase Induction Machine (IM) in an EV propulsion drive

I developed a model of a 3-phase Induction Machine in Simulink incorporating the vehicle load model which included the aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance and gravitational force. I then designed cascaded control loops using frequency response analysis for field-oriented torque and speed control. Both direct and indirect rotor flux estimation methods were used and their impact on control performance under parameter estimation errors was discussed. Finally, the transient response (shown below) was verified for a given speed profile.

### Control Software-in-Loop (SIL) Validation of a Grid Connected Voltage Source Inverter (VSI)

I designed and implemented cascaded control loops using droop control equations for real and reactive power regulation of a grid-connected inverter. A space vector PWM scheme was used to generate the modulation signals. I then wrote an external C-code for the controller and validated the system performance using the UNIFI SIL wrapper library in Simulink. The results (shown below) show a good transient response of terminal voltage at the Point of Contact (PoC) and the grid side current.

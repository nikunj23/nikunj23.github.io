# Control Systems Engineer

**Summary:** I am a Master's student at NC State University with a specialization in Power Electronics and Control Systems. I'm skilled in converter and motor modeling, simulation, and control system design and implementation. I have worked with conventional PMSMs but also the not-so-common Switched Reluctance Machines (SRMs). I am skilled in dynamometer bench setup and embedded coding on TI DSPs. I have also used tools such as dSPACE for rapid control prototyping and evaluation.
